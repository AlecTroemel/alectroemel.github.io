Earlier this year I drank the proverbial kool-aid and switch completely over to linux. As a result of that I've been trying to be more intentional with improving my linux tools knowledge. Here's some notes about grep! These tools are *dense*, so if you have any tips or tricks, send me a message!

{% highlight bash %}
grep bananas foo.txt

-i   # case insensitive
-o   # print only matching part, not whole line
-A 3 # 3 lines after match
-B 3 # 3 lines before match
-B 3 # 3 lines before and after match

-E   # enables regex
-v   # invert the match

-l   # only show filenames (useful when greping dir)
-r   # recursive search all files in dir

grep bananas fruit/ -lr
{% endhighlight %}

To use with watch, you'll need to enclose the piped command in quotes..

{% highlight bash %}
watch -n 2 'kubectl get pod | grep podname'
{% endhighlight %}

Grep and xargs make good friends, especially when you're trying to do something to a bunch of files
{% highlight bash %}
ls | grep test | xargs rm
{% endhighlight %}

[ripgrep][ripgrep] is a (faster) alternative to grep written in rust, so it must be better! Most of the stuff above works the same with `rg`.
