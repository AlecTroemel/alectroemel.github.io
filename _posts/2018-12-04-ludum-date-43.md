### Overview
This was my first Ludum Dare! The theme was "sacrifices must be made". I used the wonderful [pico-8][pico8-site], which forced me to actually make the game instead of a game engine. The game is pretty vanilla, but for the sake of having a code block here's how I did a variable length and intensity screen shake.

{% highlight lua %}
sc = 0 --shake duration
si = 2 --shake intensity

function shake_screen()
 if sc > 0 then
  camera(
   flr(rnd(si)),
   flr(rnd(si))
  )
  sc -= 1
 end
 if (sc == 0) camera(0,0) si = 2
end
{% endhighlight %}

### Description
Complete the desired sacrifices as they appear by taking bread, coin, and pig from the bottom alters and placing them on the top alters. Make sure your offerings are in the correct order, or they don’t count. Don’t let your life hit zero or your band of zealots may become the sacrifice! The source code can be found [here][source-code].

### Controls
- (left) (right) : move the zealots
- (X) : pick up a new sacrifice AND pass the items down the line
- (C) : pass the items down the line (without picking up a new one)
