There always seems to be at least one day during my work week where there isn't enough food for my lunch. That usually means getting something like Jimmy Johns, which although delicious, is not the most financially conscious decision. At the recommendation of one of my coworkers I made a bunch of burritos that I'll freeze, ready to be my knight-in-shining-tin-foil during my darkest hour.

#### Ingredients:
- 1lb beef with a packet of taco seasoning
- 1 can of black beans
- 1 cup of rice
- large flour tortilla
- a bag of shredded "mexican blend" cheese

I lost the receipt, but all the ingredients probably came out to around $9-10 at Aldi and made 6 burritos. I mixed the beef, beans, and rice together in a bowl, applied directly to the tortilla and smothered in cheese before folding/wrapping. The whole process took about 1 hour.
