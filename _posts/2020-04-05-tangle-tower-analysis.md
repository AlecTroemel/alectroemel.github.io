No big into today. Tangle Tower is a great game, and you should play it. It has amazing art and music, some clever puzzles, and an engaging story.

### Gameplayn't
Up until recently I heald the belief that games should be made "Gameplay fist". This philosphy clearly works for developers like Nintendo, who seem to view story as something to simply phacilitate the gameplay. However after developing a taste for adventure games and peculure indie games I longer think thats true. Good games center around a gameplay idea, a certain art style, a specific feeling, or a story. Tangle Tower is a game without a whole lot of "game". 


About 70% of your time in Tangle Tower is spent in a dialog box, but it does some interesting things to make its conversations interesting and engaging. 

When not talking to poeple you will be doing 3 things of varying interest
1. Finding Hidden Items: This to me wasnt a whole lot of fun. You (literally) poke around a static scene until you find something. I get that youre a detective thats supposed to be finding clues but I often just ended up clicking


 
### "The ending felt rushed"
One common thing I saw in all the reviews for Tangle Tower was they felt the ending was rushed. After finishing the game I agreed with the reviewers, it "felt" rushed. Thinking about that, I realized I didn't actually know what I meant by that. The rest of the game in my opinion has great pacing. The game creates a steady stream of new information about the main mystery through talking to characters, solving puzzles, finding hidden items, then talking to those characters again grilling them on the new item you just found. It honestly makes you feel like a detective as you slowly peice together the mystery. Then right when that loop starts to get stale the game will throw in a new element or area to progress the story and challenge all the assumptions you've been making. Its good writing all the way to the end. But the ending doesnt satisfy like it should, even though you "solve" the mystery.

The reason I think the ending falls flat is because you dont actually get to solve the mystery. The murderer just shows up, confesses to everything, then gets away. The game already has this cool system where you can make accusations or "solve" stuff, but you dont get to use it at the very end! If I were to "fix" the ending, I would line everyone up and let the player "point the finger". Let the player be tested on everything that they've learned.
