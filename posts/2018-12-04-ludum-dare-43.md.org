This was my first Ludum Dare! The theme was "sacrifices must be made". I
used the wonderful [[https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php][pico-8]],
which forced me to actually make the game instead of a game engine. The
game is pretty vanilla, but for the sake of having a code block here's
how I did a variable length and intensity screen shake.

{% highlight lua %} sc = 0 --shake duration si = 2 --shake intensity

function shake_screen() if sc > 0 then camera( flr(rnd(si)),
flr(rnd(si)) ) sc -= 1 end if (sc == 0) camera(0,0) si = 2 end {%
endhighlight %}

*** Description

    :END:

Complete the desired sacrifices as they appear by taking bread, coin,
and pig from the bottom alters and placing them on the top alters. Make
sure your offerings are in the correct order, or they don't count. Don't
let your life hit zero or your band of zealots may become the sacrifice!
