After seeing all the fancy pictures on the internet, I decided to try my
hand at replacing my Nintendo Switch's controller shells. I was able to
order
[[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07527NNBG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1][these
shells]] and
[[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MRJ12HX/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1][this
tool kit]] from Amazon, no shady Chines website required. I won't give
step by step instructions since there are tons of those online, but here
are some stray thoughts:

- *Be super organized with the screws:* Its easy to forget which screw
  goes where. I organized mine in order of how I removed them.
- *Buy the tool kit:* having the correct drivers made everything much
  easier. Plus the kit I bought came with a handle plastic separator
  tool and some nice tweezers.
- *Careful with the springs:* I almost lost some multiple times because
  I was holding them too hard and sent them flying.
- *Take your time:* Going fast is how you break stuff
- *Remove the smallest number of ribbon cables:* Of course remove the
  battery, but little ribbons are the worst. One thing I realized half
  way through is that their connectors have and open and closed state.
  Make sure its popped open when your try to position the ribbon (you
  won't have to push it very hard into place).
- *Leave the middle plastic:* The ZR button is probably the trickiest
  part to put together, but if you're ok with a tiny bit of color in
  between Z and ZR, you can just reuse that part. Plus, with one of the
  shells I ordered, that plastic part was actually defective and
  wouldn't have worked anyways.

Overall the whole project from start to finish took around 3 hours. And
although Im happy I did it, I /do not/ want to do it again anytime soon.
I find myself drawn to projects like this one that include small
springs, circuits, soldering (more on this later), etc. Maybe its
because I'm tired of staring at a screen all day and want to try
something hard with my hands. In any case something always goes wrong
...I drop a piece and loose it in the carpet, or I spend an hour on that
one litle piece that just WILL NOT GO IN ITS SPOT, or worst of all I put
the whole joycon together only to realize the colored buttons are in the
wrong spot. Maybe that makes finishing the project it all that much
sweeter... I'm still deciding whether or not that's the
