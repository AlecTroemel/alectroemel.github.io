There always seems to be at least one day during my work week where
there isn't enough food for my lunch. That usually means getting
something like Jimmy Johns, which although delicious, is not the most
financially conscious decision. At the recommendation of one of my
coworkers I made a bunch of burritos that I'll freeze, ready to be my
knight-in-shining-tin-foil during my darkest hour.

**** Ingredients:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: ingredients
     :END:

- 1lb beef with a packet of taco seasoning
- 1 can of black beans
- 1 cup of rice
- large flour tortilla
- a bag of shredded "mexican blend" cheese

I lost the receipt, but all the ingredients probably came out to around
$9-10 at Aldi and made 6 burritos. I mixed the beef, beans, and rice
together in a bowl, applied directly to the tortilla and smothered in
cheese before folding/wrapping. The whole process took about 1 hour.
